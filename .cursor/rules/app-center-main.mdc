# App Center Project Rules

## Project Overview
This is a TypeScript monorepo with:
- Frontend: Next.js 15 + React 19 + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn UI  
- Backend: Express.js + Better SQLite3 + TypeScript
- Package Manager: pnpm with workspaces
- Architecture: Full-stack mobile app distribution center

## General Standards

### TypeScript
- Always use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer type safety over any types
- Use proper interface definitions for API contracts
- Import types with `import type` syntax when possible
- Use shared types from `@app-center/shared` package

### File Organization
- Keep components in `frontend/components/`
- Keep API routes in `frontend/app/api/` and `backend/src/routes/`
- Keep shared types in `shared/types/`
- Use proper barrel exports (index.ts files)
- Group related functionality in folders

## Security Best Practices
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Use proper sanitization for file uploads
- Implement rate limiting on API endpoints
- Use helmet for security headers
- Never commit sensitive credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration

## Testing & Quality
- Write meaningful commit messages in English
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Run linting and type checking before commits
- Test API endpoints thoroughly
- Use proper error handling patterns

## Helpful Commands
- `pnpm dev` - Start development servers
- `pnpm build` - Build all packages
- `pnpm lint` - Run linting
- `pnpm type-check` - Type checking
- `pnpm clean` - Clean build artifacts

## Dependencies Management
- Use exact versions for critical dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use workspace dependencies with `workspace:*`
- Prefer peer dependencies when appropriate

Remember: Always prioritize type safety, security, and maintainability over quick fixes.
