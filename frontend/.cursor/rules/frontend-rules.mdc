# Frontend Rules for App Center

## React/Next.js Guidelines
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer server components when possible in Next.js 15
- Use the app router for new routes
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with consistent design tokens
- Follow Shadcn UI patterns for accessible components

## Component Patterns
- Keep components in `frontend/components/`
- Use proper prop interfaces with TypeScript
- Implement loading and error states
- Use React Suspense for data fetching
- Follow composition over inheritance

## Styling Guidelines
- Use Tailwind CSS for all styling
- Follow consistent design tokens
- Use CSS modules only when Tailwind is insufficient
- Implement responsive design mobile-first
- Use proper semantic HTML elements

## Performance Guidelines
- Use Next.js Image component for images
- Implement proper lazy loading
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports
- Implement proper caching strategies

## Avoid These Patterns
- Don't use deprecated React patterns (class components, etc.)
- Don't expose sensitive information in client-side code
- Don't ignore accessibility best practices
- Don't skip error boundaries
- Don't hardcode API endpoints
